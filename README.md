ExtendScript.Geo  
================  

A collection of functions for calculating geo locations. As used in [AEMap.jsx](http://aescripts.com/aemap/) and [Locations.jsx](http://aescripts.com/locations/)

These functions are heavily based on mbostocks protoviz.
Why protoviz and not D3? because extracting some projection types from D3 is much more complex then using protoviz
